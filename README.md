# PaladinScripts
All these scripts are for Genie and for use in the game DragonRealms

FOR SELF:

assess.cmd - a top-down visual representation of the ASSESS command that shows what enemies are around you and what number they are

FOR GROUPS:

Group health subs - copy these to the substitutes.cfg file

group.cmd - like group list but updates with more information and faster, and can help leaders regroup when people go missing. Works good but needs a lot more work.

moving.cmd - sets up a window to show a countdown timer when someone says "in 5" for example. Also triggers retreat.cmd

retreat.cmd - auto retreats, will yell for help if you cant retreat or getting hurt, and can start with a direction to move that direction once retreated

FOR PALADINS:

lead.cmd - automatically sets up LEAD whenever possible

protect.cmd - automatically covers the target whenever possible
